# QR Treasure Hunt (Stateless Version)

An offline-capable web application for scavenging QR codes to collect digital stamps and points.

## 📱 QR Code Format

The QR codes generated by this application contain a JSON object with all treasure details. This allows any device to verify the treasure without needing a synchronized database.

  {
    "id": "uuid-v4-string",
    "name": "Treasure Name",
    "points": 50,
    "desc": "Optional description text"
  }
  ```
