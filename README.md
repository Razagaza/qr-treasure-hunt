# QR Treasure Hunt (Local Storage Version)

An offline-capable web application for scavenging QR codes to collect digital stamps and points.

*Note: This version uses `localStorage` for data persistence. No backend server or database is required.*

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. QR Scanner (`/scan`)
- Real-time QR recognition using mobile camera (Default: Back Camera)
- Prevents duplicate collection of the same treasure
- Celebration animations and point accumulation

### 2. Admin Portal (`/admin`)
- **Access**: Manually navigate to `/admin` (Hidden from UI)
- Create and manage treasures
- Generate and download QR codes instantly

### 3. User Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- View total points and collected stamps
- Visualize discovered treasures

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), Vanilla CSS
- **Storage**: Browser LocalStorage (No Backend)
- **Scanning**: html5-qrcode
- **Generation**: qrcode.react

## 📱 QR Code Format

The QR codes generated by this application simply contain the **UUID** of the treasure.

- **Content**: A unique string (UUID v4)
- **Example**: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`

When the scanner reads this UUID, it looks up the treasure details from the local storage database.

> **Important**: Since data is local, the "Admin" device and "Scanner" device must be the same for the demo to work flawlessly out-of-the-box (unless you manually sync/export the `qr_hunt_treasures` local storage key).

## 📦 Getting Started

```

### 3. Deployment (Vercel)

## ⚠️ Notes
- **Data Persistence**: Clearing browser cache will wipe all user progress and created treasures.
